# Lazy NFT Minting

Lazy minting occurs when a new NFT is created "off-chain," or outside of the blockchain, after its successful sale on the blockchain. Lazy minting allows creators to avoid paying an up-front gas fee while minting their NFTs or NFT collections on the blockchain

## LazyNFT Contract

The LazyNFT contract is a Solidity smart contract that implements the ERC721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It provides a basic structure for creating and managing NFTs within the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes additional functionalities inherited from ERC721URIStorage, Ownable, and EIP712 contracts.

## Usage

```
1. Copy LazyNFT.sol and paste it to Remix IDE
```
```
2. Deploy the Contract
```
```
3. Run index.html in your local machine
```
```
4. Run main() inside browser console
```
```
5. Copy the voucher that main() returns
```
```
6. Pass voucher details to safeMint function 
```
``` 
Thats It...
```
